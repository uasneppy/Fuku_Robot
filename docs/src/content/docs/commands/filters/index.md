# 🔍 Filters Commands

Filters are case insensitive; every time someone says your trigger words, Fuku will reply something else! This can be used to create your commands, if desired.

Commands:
- /filter <trigger> <reply>: Every time someone says trigger, the bot will reply with sentence. For multiple word filters, quote the trigger.
- /filters: List all chat filters.
- /stop <trigger>: Stop the bot from replying to trigger.
- /stopall: Stop ALL filters in the current chat. This action cannot be undone.

Examples:
- Set a filter:
-> /filter hello Hello there! How are you?
- Set a multiword filter:
-> /filter hello friend Hello back! Long time no see!
- Set a filter that can only be used by admins:
-> /filter example This filter won't  happen if a normal user says it {admin}
- To save a file, image, gif, or any other attachment, simply reply to the file with:
-> /filter trigger

**Advanced Features:**

**Random Responses:**
Use `%%%` to separate multiple responses. One will be picked randomly:
`/filter hello Hi there!%%%Hello!%%%Hey, how are you?`

**Media Filters:**
Reply to any media (photo, video, document, sticker, etc.) with `/filter trigger` to create a filter that sends that media.

**Noformat Mode:**
Admins can view the raw filter content (including formatting codes) by adding `noformat` after the trigger:
`hello noformat`
This is useful for debugging filters or seeing button configurations.

**Filter Buttons:**
You can add inline buttons to your filters:
`/filter hello Hello! Check out these links:
[Button 1](buttonurl:https://example.com)
[Button 2](buttonurl:https://example2.com)`

**Important:** When re-adding an existing filter keyword, the bot shows an inline

exceeding this limit returns an error.
