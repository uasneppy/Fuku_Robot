# Handler Group Precedence

gotgbot dispatches incoming updates to handlers in ascending group number order. Lower group numbers fire first. Within the same group, handlers fire in registration order. A handler returning `ext.EndGroups` stops all further group processing for that update. `ext.ContinueGroups` allows downstream groups to continue firing.

This page documents every registered message watcher with its exact handler group number, verified from source code.

## Precedence Table

| Group | Module | Handler | Filter | Return on Match | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| -10 | Captcha | `handlePendingCaptchaMessage` | nil (all messages) | `EndGroups` | Intercepts messages from users with pending captcha; stores and deletes message |
| -5 | AntiRaid | `antiRaidJoinHandler` | ChatMember (user joined) | `EndGroups` | Intercepts new member joins during raid mode; auto-restricts or bans joiners |
| -2 | Antispam | (inline closure) | `message.All` | `EndGroups` | Rate-limits spamming users; passes through if not spamming |
| -1 | BotUpdates | `botJoinedGroup` | MyChatMember (bot joined) | `EndGroups` | Early interceptor for bot group joins; leaves non-supergroups |
| -1 | Users | `logUsers` | `message.All` | `ContinueGroups` | Logs user activity; never blocks propagation |
| 0 | All modules | Commands, callbacks | Various | varies | Default group; standard command handlers |
| 4 | Antiflood | `checkFlood` | `message.All` | `EndGroups` on flood, `ContinueGroups` otherwise | Flood control; skips anon admins and media groups |
| 5 | Locks | `permHandler` | `message.All` | `EndGroups` on violation | Permission-based locks (can_send_messages, etc.) |
| 6 | Locks | `restHandler` | `message.All` | `EndGroups` on violation | Restriction-based locks (stickers, animations, etc.) |
| 7 | Blacklists | `blacklistWatcher` | non-command, non-media-group | `ContinueGroups` (always) | Checks words against blacklist; action taken but processing continues |
| 8 | Reports | (handler) | `message.All` | varies | Report tracking |
| 8 | Reactions | `checkReactions` | `message.All` | `EndGroups` | Checks message reactions against configured patterns; takes action (mute/ban) on violation |
| 9 | Filters | `filtersWatcher` | non-command, non-media-group | `ContinueGroups` (always) | Matches filter patterns; sends configured response but does not block |
| 10 | Pins | (handler) | `message.All` | `EndGroups` | Anti-channel-pin watcher |

## Propagation Behavior

:::caution[Critical propagation rules]
Understanding these rules is essential for debugging why a message did or did not trigger a particular watcher.

- **Captcha is first (group -10).** Any message from a user with a pending captcha is stored for moderator review and deleted. The message never reaches antiraid, antispam, antiflood, blacklists, or filters.
- **AntiRaid intercepts joins (group -5).** During raid mode, new member joins are intercepted and auto-restricted before reaching downstream handlers.
- **Antispam EndGroups stops all further processing.** When antispam (group -2) returns `EndGroups` for a rate-limited user, every downstream handler is skipped. A rate-limited message never reaches any other watcher.
- **Blacklists and Filters use ContinueGroups.** Both take their configured action (warn, mute, ban for blacklists; send reply for filters) but do not block downstream watchers. A message matching a blacklist word still gets checked by filters.

## Interaction Examples

### Scenario 1: User with pending captcha sends a message

1. **Captcha (group -10)** intercepts the message, stores it in the pending queue, and deletes it from the chat.
2. Returns `EndGroups`. Nothing else fires.
3. After successful verification, the stored messages are deleted and the bot sends a type/count summary; their contents are not replayed.

### Scenario 2: User sends a flood of messages

1. Captcha (group -10) passes through (no pending captcha).
2. AntiRaid (group -5) passes through (raid mode not active).
3. Antispam (group -2) passes through (not yet rate-limited).
4. Users (group -1) logs activity, continues.
5. Commands (group 0) fire normally for earlier messages.
6. **Antiflood (group 4)** triggers after the flood threshold is reached, returns `EndGroups`.
7. Locks, blacklists, filters, and pins are all skipped for that message.

### Scenario 3: Message matches both a blacklist word and a filter

1. Captcha (group -10) passes through.
2. AntiRaid (group -5) passes through (raid mode not active).
3. Antispam (group -2) passes through.
4. Users (group -1) logs activity, continues.
5. Commands (group 0) — not a command, passes.
6. Antiflood (group 4) — not flooding, continues.
7. **Locks (groups 5-6)** check permissions. Message passes (no lock violation).
8. **Blacklists (group 7)** matches the word, takes configured action (e.g., warn user), returns `ContinueGroups`.
9. Reports (group 8) tracks the message.
10. **Filters (group 9)** matches the filter pattern, sends the configured response, returns `ContinueGroups`.
11. Pins (group 10) checks for anti-channel-pin conditions.

Both the blacklist action and the filter response are triggered for the same message.
