# Performance Profiling

Fuku Robot supports Go's pprof profiling tool for diagnosing performance bottlenecks. This guide covers how to enable and use profiling endpoints.

:::danger[Production Safety]
pprof endpoints should **NEVER** be enabled in production. They expose detailed runtime information including memory contents, goroutine stacks, and internal state that can aid attackers. Only enable for development or debugging temporary issues in staging environments behind a firewall.
:::

## Enabling Profiling

### Environment Variable

```bash
# Enable pprof endpoints (development only!)
ENABLE_PPROF=true
```

When enabled, the following endpoints become available:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/debug/pprof/` | Index of available profiles |
| `/debug/pprof/heap` | Heap memory profile |
| `/debug/pprof/goroutine` | Goroutine stack trace |
| `/debug/pprof/threadcreate` | Thread creation profile |
| `/debug/pprof/block` | Block (goroutine blocking) profile |
| `/debug/pprof/mutex` | Mutex contention profile |

:::note
The block and mutex profiles are **disabled by default** in Go. With `ENABLE_PPROF=true` set, the endpoints are exposed but will return empty data unless you enable collection via `GODEBUG=blockprofilerate=1,mutexprofilefraction=1` environment variable or `runtime.SetBlockProfileRate()` in code.
:::

### CPU Profiling

CPU profiling requires a separate request:

```bash
# Collect 30 seconds of CPU profile
curl -o cpu.pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30
```

## Using pprof

### Interactive Analysis

Start the pprof interactive console:

```bash
go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap
```

Common commands in pprof:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `top` | Show top functions by resource usage |
| `web` | Open visual graph in browser |
| `list funcname` | Show source for specific function |
| `traces` | Print all sample traces |

### Examples

#### Option 1: Web UI Mode

```bash
# Open web UI at http://localhost:8081
go tool pprof -http=:8081 http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap
```

Use the web interface to explore the profile visually.

#### Option 2: Interactive Console

```bash
# Drop into interactive console
go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap

# Then run commands like:
(pprof) top
(pprof) web
(pprof) list functionname
```

#### Goroutine Analysis

```bash
# Get goroutine dump in console mode
go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/goroutine

# Check for goroutine leaks
(pprof) top
```

#### CPU Profiling

```bash
# Collect 30 seconds of CPU profile
# Note: The server has a 10s WriteTimeout - use shorter duration or profile externally
go tool pprof -seconds=30 http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile
```

## Flame Graphs

Flame graphs provide a visual representation of CPU or memory usage.

### Option 1: go tool pprof (Recommended)

The simplest way to generate flame graphs:

```bash
# Generate SVG flame graph from heap profile
go tool pprof -svg -output=heap-flamegraph.svg http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap

# Generate SVG flame graph from CPU profile (30 seconds)
go tool pprof -svg -output=cpu-flamegraph.svg http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30

# Or open in browser directly
go tool pprof -http=:8081 http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap
```

### Option 2: FlameGraph Perl Scripts

For more control, use Brendan Gregg's FlameGraph tools:

```bash
# Clone the FlameGraph repository
git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph.git
cd FlameGraph

# Generate heap flame graph from pprof
# First, get the profile as raw protobuf
curl -s http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap > heap.pb

# Convert to SVG using go tool pprof to export folded stacks
go tool pprof -proto -output=heap.folded ./your-binary heap.pb

# Generate flame graph
./flamegraph.pl heap.folded > heap-flamegraph.svg
```

## Common Performance Issues

### High Memory Usage

1. Collect heap profile during peak usage
2. Look for objects that shouldn't be retained
3. Check for unbounded caches or slices

### Goroutine Leaks

1. Compare goroutine profiles over time
2. Look for goroutines waiting on channels
3. Check for missing context cancellations

### CPU Spikes

1. Collect CPU profile during spike
2. Identify hot code paths
3. Look for busy loops or excessive locking

## Production Alternatives

:::tip
For production environments, use Prometheus metrics and the built-in auto-remediation system instead of pprof. They provide observability without exposing internal runtime details.
:::

For production monitoring without pprof:

- Use Prometheus metrics for observability
- Enable `ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING` for auto-remediation
- Monitor `/metrics` endpoint for custom metrics
- Use external APM tools (Datadog, New Relic)

## Troubleshooting

### Profile is Empty

- Ensure traffic is hitting the bot during collection
- CPU profiles require active processing

### Connection Refused

- Verify `ENABLE_PPROF=true` is set
- Check bot is running and port is correct
- Ensure firewall allows access to pprof port
