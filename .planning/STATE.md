# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-05)

**Core value:** My trusted staff can protect every one of my communities from one place. We act on a bad actor across all groups at once, and the bot never lets anyone act in a group where they aren't an admin.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — Staff Audit and Undo

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (Staff Audit and Undo) — EXECUTING
Plan: 8 of 9
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-10-05 — Phase 03 execution started

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 22%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in the PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Image classification uses Gemini `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (owner's decision). This replaces the research STACK's Claude Haiku / `anthropic-sdk-go` recommendation, so Phase 7 research must target Gemini.
- [Roadmap]: Raid auto-triggers are on by default with conservative thresholds (owner's decision), not "off until configured" as the research suggested.
- [Roadmap]: Multiple replicas are the deployment target, so fan-out pacing and detection counters go through Redis, not an in-process limiter. This closes research gap 5.
- [Roadmap]: PLAT-03 is mapped to Phase 1, PLAT-01 to Phase 2 and PLAT-02 to Phase 7, where each first matters. All three still apply to every later phase (see ROADMAP Cross-Cutting Constraints).
- [Roadmap]: LOCK-10 (one lockdown and one alert per raid) is in Phase 6, where concurrent auto-triggers first exist.
- [Phase 1]: Role exclusivity is enforced by a PostgreSQL trigger with per-chat advisory locks (owner's pick), on top of in-transaction app checks.
- [Phase 1]: Only a definite owner mismatch removes a link; Telegram errors are unknown and change nothing. Phase 2's pre-action owner recheck should reuse `staff.*Fresh` + `chat_status.CheckOwner` the same way.
- [Phase 1]: Exactly-once Staff Group notices come from conditional writes (RowsAffected == 1 posts), not locks.
- [Phase 2]: One decision table (`decideStaffAction`) picks each group's Telegram call from the target's live status, so no staff action lifts a ban. Phase 3's "Undo everywhere" must reuse it rather than calling Telegram directly.
- [Phase 2]: Staff fan-out calls go through the fleet-wide Redis pacer (`staffPaced`); a slot more than 60 s away fails at once as "rate limited". One run per target is held by a Redis lock renewed every 10 minutes.
- [Phase 2]: The reason shows on the card and in the summary only. Posting to linked groups' log channels (STAFF-09), the audit record (STAFF-10) and "Undo everywhere" (STAFF-11) are Phase 3.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Spike gate. Test whether approved users can be exempted from a locked default, and how joins arrive. If the exemption is impossible, the owner picks the LOCK-03 fallback before planning.
- [Phase 7]: Spike gate. Evaluate Gemini on spam images, GIFs and stickers, then run `/gsd-ai-integration-phase`.
- [Phase 8]: Spike gate. Test Direct Link Mini App launch from a group, and Turnstile rendering in Telegram WebViews. The owner must provide a public HTTPS hostname, a BotFather Mini App and Turnstile keys.
- [Phase 1]: The live ownership-transfer check (does `chat_owner_changed`/`chat_member` arrive, with the bot as admin and as a member) was never run; UAT tests 3-4 were deferred. The hourly sweep removes stale links whatever Telegram sends.
- [Phase 1]: 10 of 11 live-Telegram UAT checks were deferred without being run (`phases/01-staff-group-links/01-UAT.md` Deferred Follow-Ups). CI had not run on PR #1 at phase close; the PostgreSQL trigger test passed locally against PostgreSQL 16.
- [Phase 1]: Low, non-blocking security flag TF-01-06: a stranger's `/unlinkstaff` reply reveals whether the group is linked (`01-SECURITY.md`).
- [Phase 2]: Open code-review finding WR-03 (warning): at a `retry_after` of exactly 60 s, all but the first concurrent paced call fail as "rate limited" instead of waiting. Those groups are still reported. Nine info notes are open too (`02-REVIEW-DISPOSITION.md`).
- [Phase 2]: `TestStaffActionNonStaffUnchanged/tmute_as_a_reply` is flaky (2 of 6 verifier runs red): two runs straddle a wall-clock second in `until_date`. Test-only; it can turn `make test` red intermittently.
- [Cross-phase]: Some requirements are only partly checkable in their own phase, and a later phase finishes them. The `/staff` in-lockdown status (SETUP-08) lands in Phase 4. The alert's Lift button (LOCK-06), and listing removed joiners on the alert (LOCK-01), land in Phase 5. The AI-trigger toggle (RAID-06) lands in Phase 7.
